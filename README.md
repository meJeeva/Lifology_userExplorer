Here's the corrected and elaborated version of your description:

I am using React Native CLI and React Navigation to navigate between screens in my project. 
First, I will initialize stack navigation, which will include all the navigation screens. 
Then, I will create three main screens: SplashScreen, HomeScreen, and PostScreen.

SplashScreen: This screen will be displayed first, showing the company logo and name.
HomeScreen: After the splash screen, the home screen will display a list of all users fetched from a dummy API. The list will feature infinite scrolling to load more users as you scroll down.
PostScreen: When a user is selected from the list on the home screen, the app will navigate to the post screen, where the posts made by that particular user (fetched from another API) will be displayed. The post list will also include infinite scrolling to load more posts as needed.
Each screen will handle its own data fetching, and both user lists and post lists will implement infinite scrolling for a smooth user experience.

Thanking You
